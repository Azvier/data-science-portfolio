## üòé About Me

I am a dedicated Statistics student at Hasanuddin University with a core expertise in **data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence**. My experience extends to research, project coordination, and statistical modeling, and I am proficient with tools such as Python, R Studio, IBM SPSS, Microsoft Excel, and BI Tools (e.g. Power BI, Tableau).

My objective is to apply these skills to support effective, data-informed decision-making within business and policy contexts. I am passionate about uncovering the stories hidden within data and developing solutions that drive impactful outcomes. This repository serves as a showcase of my journey and projects in the world of data.

##  üóÇÔ∏è Structure of This Portfolio (Monorepo)

This repository uses a monorepo structure, meaning all my projects are housed here for centralized management. Each project resides in its own numbered directory (e.g., `01-Project-Name/`) and contains its own specific `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, data, notebooks, and scripts.

The root directory contains this main `README.md` (you are here!), a `LICENSE` file, and a general `.gitignore`.
